This project contains Hour and Minute settings widgets.

DialViewHour.hour and DialViewMinute.minute variables can be used to obtain the values of hour and minute as displayed by the dial.

A sample usage is also shown in the DialsDemoActivity and the main.xml.

These are dial based widget so you can set hour and minute more quickly compared to standard android widgets.

A SmartTime.java class is also provided which can be used to format time in displayable format.

The live usage of these widgets in an app can be seen at https://market.android.com/details?id=in.dharmin.smartalarm
